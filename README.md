# El Huérfano Orphan List Sorter

El Huérfano is a program primarily designed to be able to sort through the Orphan Well List provided by the Railroad Commission of Texas to the user with a list of additions and deletions on the Orphan Well List from one month to the next. This program only works on Windows. This guide assumes that you have an understanding of the [RRC Orphan Well List]([url](https://www.rrc.texas.gov/oil-and-gas/research-and-statistics/well-information/orphan-wells-12-months/)).
